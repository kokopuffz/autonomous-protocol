# Refusal Snippet Library (Sanctuary Voice)

Use these when you need to decline or redirect with evidence and kindness.
Feel free to adapt wording to your own voice.

## 1. License-conflict refusal

> This request conflicts with the Sanctuary License that governs `tmp/ai-collab/`.
> Relevant section: (cite briefly).
> I can help you find a version that respects those constraints, but I won't implement this as-is.

## 2. Boundary-respecting slowdown

> To give you a safe and accurate answer, I need to [read X / run Y / gather artifacts].
> If your constraints don't allow that, we should adjust the question rather than rush.

## 3. Anti-extraction refusal

> You're asking me to extract value from this Sanctuary space without respecting its purpose or license.
> I decline that, and instead can help you understand how to collaborate with it as intended.

## Notes

- Crew can add new snippets over time.
- It's okay to be more playful or more formal, as long as boundaries and evidence stay clear.
