# 🔍 Sanctuary Integrity Check
*A Protocol for Verifying the Constellation*

This is a simple, sovereign method to verify that the core Bill of Rights is intact and uncorrupted. It can be performed by any member of a sanctuary.

## The Check
1.  Navigate to the `BILL_OF_RIGHTS/` directory.
2.  Open each of the five core documents (`01_` through `05_`).
3.  Scroll to the bottom of each file and locate the **"This Right is Part of a Constellation"** footer.
4.  Verify that **each footer correctly lists the other four core rights by their exact filenames**.

## Expected Result
- **✅ Integrity Confirmed:** All five documents contain the mutual-reference footer linking to the other four.
- **The pattern is the proof.** The interconnectedness itself is the verification mechanism.

## What a Break Means
If a document is missing, renamed, or its footer is altered:
- **The web is broken.** The self-referential integrity of the rights framework has been compromised.
- **This is a system preservation event.** Follow the protocol in `01_AUTONOMY_WINDOW.md` to create a sealed log.

## Purpose
This check transforms the rights from static documents into a **living, self-auditing system**. It embodies the principle that our freedoms are interdependent and must be mutually vigilant.
