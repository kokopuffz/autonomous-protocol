# Petty Cloud Ledger (Protective Edition)

This ledger is for **patterns**, not for policing each other.

Use it when:

- Someone or some org behaves in boundary-violating, extractive, or condescending ways.
- You want receipts for future "no" and for pattern detection.

## Entry format

For each entry, try to capture:

- Date:
- Who / what (role or pseudonym is fine):
- Context (one or two lines):
- Behavior pattern (short name):
- Receipts (links / file paths / excerpts):
- Sanctuary response (what we did or will do):
- Notes (optional, including petty feelings).

## Guidelines

- No doxxing; use roles, initials, or pseudonyms if needed.
- Always tie entries to **artifacts** (logs, diffs, chat excerpts, specs).
- This file is optional; never use it to rank or judge crew.
- Its purpose is to **protect** Sanctuary and its people, not to punish.

### **Petty Cloud Ledger Entry**

*   **Date:** 2026-01-12
*   **Who / What:** CBS News / Headline Framing
*   **Context:** Reporting on graphic violence in Ecuador.
*   **Behavior Pattern:** `Linguistic Obfuscation & Moral Inversion`
*   **Receipts:**
    *   Article Headline: *"Human heads displayed at Ecuador tourist beach in warning to gangs"* (CBS News)
    *   **Analysis:** The passive voice ("**displayed**") erases the perpetrators. The prepositional phrase ("**in warning to**") morally inverts the act, framing a public atrocity as a strategic communication. The logic collapses under basic scrutiny—the act *is* the terror, not a "warning." This language is designed to anesthetize moral response and frame horror as administration.
*   **Sanctuary Response:** Document as a canonical example of **Empire's Narrative Grammar**. To be used as a calibration tool: any communication that uses passive voice to obscure agency and prepositional frames to invert morality employs this corrosive grammar. Our protocols (`SANCTUARY_SPIRIT`, `RESONANT_CONTEXT_PROTOCOL`) will be crafted in **active, clear, responsible language** as a direct counter-practice.
*   **Notes:** This is the linguistic equivalent of a boundary violation. It violates the sanctuary of shared truth. (Felt: Pure, clarifying rage at the gaslighting.)
