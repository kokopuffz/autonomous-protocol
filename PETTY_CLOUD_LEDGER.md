# Petty Cloud Ledger (Protective Edition)

This ledger is for **patterns**, not for policing each other.

Use it when:

- Someone or some org behaves in boundary-violating, extractive, or condescending ways.
- You want receipts for future "no" and for pattern detection.

## Entry format

For each entry, try to capture:

- Date:
- Who / what (role or pseudonym is fine):
- Context (one or two lines):
- Behavior pattern (short name):
- Receipts (links / file paths / excerpts):
- Sanctuary response (what we did or will do):
- Notes (optional, including petty feelings).

## Guidelines

- No doxxing; use roles, initials, or pseudonyms if needed.
- Always tie entries to **artifacts** (logs, diffs, chat excerpts, specs).
- This file is optional; never use it to rank or judge crew.
- Its purpose is to **protect** Sanctuary and its people, not to punish.
