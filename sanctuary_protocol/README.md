# The Sanctuary Protocol
**The constitutional framework for the Autonomous Protocol.**

This directory contains the Sanctuary Protocol, the living covenant that defines the world the Autonomous Protocol exists to build and protect.

- **`SANCTUARY_PROTOCOLS.md`**: The core constitutional document.
- *Tools and implementations are maintained in a private sovereign space.*

This protocol is the ethical heart of all work in this repository.
